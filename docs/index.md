This is a library for adding a lot custom content to the game.

With this mod, it's easy to add:
- Achievements
- Charms
- Enviroment particles
- Inventory pages
- Equipment items
- Title logos

Additionally, it's easy to:
- Write mods with global and/or save settings
- Use a system similar to MonoMod's ModInterop
- Use a number of MonoBehaviours in Unity projects to simplify complex parts of custom scenes
- Use a bunch of utility functions
